        question: `When updating state using the input’s onChange`,
        answers: {
            a: "It’s ok to update setState directly, because onChange is called every time we press a key, and setState is asynchronous so we want to guarantee the input is correct",
            b: "We should still use setState, knowing that on the last key-press everything will be reset accordingly despite the fact that setState is asynchronous",
            c: "We should always use setState, period",
            d: "It’s ok to update setState directly, because nothing is dependant on this data except for the input itself"

    },
    16: {
        question: `When we bind an input’s value attribute to a value in state,`,
        answers: {
            a: "We must give it an onChange attribute, else it will never change",
            b: "We must verify that the value exists in state",
            c: "Neither a nor b",
            d: "Both a and b"

            b: "Regex matching only matters if we use “exact” in our Route",
            c: "If we don’t use exact, Router will use regex to find matches in our 'path' attribute, and render accordingly",
            d: "We need to write correct regular expressions in our 'path'"
        }
    },
    19: {
        question: `The way to pass data to a route is`,
        answers: {
            a: "Effectively the same as passing down props",
            b: "Requires arrow syntax for the props themselves",
            c: "Not related to routes - this has to do with components",
            d: "Limited, we can only pass one piece of data (i.e. no arrays or objects)"

        }
    },
    21: {
        question: `If we have a route like /posts/latest/3?`,
        answers: {
            a: "We can’t properly use the Link tag",
            b: "We should use a normal a tag with an href attribute to access it",
